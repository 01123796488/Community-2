      Thank you for opening up a releases issue! The intent of this is to create alignment, and less "complete" release issues created earlier are better than "perfect" issues created when everything is fully known.

      Adding labels on this release issue and adding it to the "Product releases" project table helps to categorize and track the timeframe for the ship. Release owners (that's you!) should apply this information near the time of creating the issue or as soon possible.

      There should be a label for:
      - plan (All dotcom products, PRO, Team...)
      - release phase (Alpha, Public Beta, GA, etc.) - If this is for a different release phase, use a different issue template.
      - GHES and version (GHES - NA or GHES, GHES 2.xx)

      Read about the definitions for each release phase, deciding between them, and how to go about executing them at https://github.com/github/product/blob/master/product-release-phases.md

      Every week the product operations team checks for this information and will ask for you to provide anything that's missing. See the README.md guidance as needed.

    label: Expected ship date
    description: Use specific date format YYYY-MM-DD, and please avoid non-specific dates such as "FYQ4" or "June". Pick a best-guess release date and revise as needed. If shipping different phases (Alpha, Beta, GA) create separate release issues and link them through comments/descriptions.

    label: Will this feature, in its current release phase, flow into GitHub AE?
    description: This is controlled technically by whether the feature is still wrapped in a feature flag, has GHAE exclusion logic, or whether the flag is explicitly activated for GHAE. If so, select "Yes" and also pick the version label (if known). The GHES version will likely be the basis for the GHAE version. If the beta, for example, won't but the GA will, select "No" and also apply the `GHAE - NA` label to this issue.
    options:
      - "No"
      - "Yes - GHAE 3.2"
      - "Yes - GHAE 3.3"

      - "Yes - GHAE 3.5"

    label: Will this feature, in its current release phase, flow into GitHub Enterprise Server?
    description: This is controlled technically by whether the feature is still wrapped in a feature flag, has GHES exclusion logic, or whether the flag is explicitly activated for GHES.

If the beta, for example, won't but the GA will, select "No" and also apply the `GHES - NA` label to this issue.

      - "No"
      - "Yes - GHES 3.2"
      - "Yes - GHES 3.3"
